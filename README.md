A Thymeleaf and Spring Boot based MUN Manager application which:
- Integrates with Google Drive
- Can manage hundreds of students
- Allows administrators to create conferences, assign deadlines, and check work through a Drive-connected interface

  This was a recently open-sourced project of mine, so I will update the documentation afterwards.
